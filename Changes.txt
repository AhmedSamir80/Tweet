Readme.R

Install additional packages (Line 27,28)

1)caret -> for confusion matrix
2)randomforst -> for randomforest model






RunModel.R

1) Adding two additional parameters specified for random forest Hyper Parameters (Line 14)
	a) RFtrees -> Number of trees in the forest
	b) MaxNodes -> Max nodes in each tree

2) Adding Section for Random Forest Model (check line 180)

3) confusion matrix is calculated instead of accuracy 
return confusion matrix instead of Accuracy (check line 224)



AutoRunModel.R

1)Loop on Random Forest Model (Line 38)
2)if model is Random Forest loop on Hyper parameter (RFtrees and MaxNodes) (Line 51,52)
  else work as same combination of parameter with intial RFTree and Max Nodes which will not cause any issue for any other model

3)function CrossValidatehas been updated to below
	a) we write the results of each model run (from Line 151 to 182)
	b) do not return any results

4)function AutoRunModel is updated and don't wait for resultes from CrossValidate function
